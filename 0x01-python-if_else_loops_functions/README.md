# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description

This project focuses on Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and functions. It introduces control flow structures and how to use them effectively in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use `if`, `if...else`, and `if...elif...else` statements.
- Work with `while` and `for` loops.
- Define and use functions in Python.
- Understand the concept of scope and variable lifetime.
- Use the `return` statement to return values from functions.
