# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on Python programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, unit testing, and serialization/deserialization.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of unit testing.
- Learn how to serialize and deserialize objects in Python.
- Explore the use of `*args` and `**kwargs`.
- Gain experience with object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

## Project Structure

- **models/**: Contains the Python classes for the project.

  - `base.py`: The base class for all other classes.
  - `rectangle.py`: A class that inherits from `Base` and represents a rectangle.
  - `square.py`: A class that inherits from `Rectangle` and represents a square.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - `test_base.py`: Unit tests for the `Base` class.
  - `test_rectangle.py`: Unit tests for the `Rectangle` class.
  - `test_square.py`: Unit tests for the `Square` class.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
